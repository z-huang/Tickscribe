Tickscribe is a nimble and efficient tool for real-time audio transcription, capable of providing immediate text output from your microphone. It goes a step further by offering optional Language Model (LLM) summarization, making it ideal for capturing meeting notes, lectures, and voice memos quickly and effectively.

## ‚ú® Key Features:

* **Instant Real-time Audio Transcription:** Witness spoken words transform into text as you speak, providing immediate feedback and a live transcript.
* **Intelligent LLM Summarization (Optional):** Leverage the power of Language Models to condense lengthy transcripts into concise and informative summaries, saving you time and effort.
* **Effortless Setup and Usage:** Designed with simplicity in mind, Tickscribe is easy to install and run, requiring minimal configuration to get started.
* **Local Storage:** Store your audio and transcriptions locally.

    ```

4.  **Run Tickscribe:** Execute the main script to start the transcription process:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## üöÄ Roadmap: Exciting Features in Development!

We're continuously working to enhance Tickscribe with the following features:

* **Enhanced LLM Summarization Capabilities:** Exploring more advanced Language Models and summarization techniques to provide even more insightful and context-aware summaries.
* **Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developing a user-friendly interface for easier interaction, configuration, and visualization of the transcription and summarization processes.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Expanding language options beyond the initial implementation to cater to a global user base.

## üîó References and Inspiration:

Tickscribe draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from the following excellent projects:

* **MLX Hugging Face Integration:** Leveraging the power of MLX for efficient on-device model execution. ([https://huggingface.co/mlx-community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community))
* **MLX Core Library:** Building upon the flexible and performant MLX framework. ([https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx))
